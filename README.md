<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A plugin for templating in Obsidian, powered by Nunjucks. Spiritual successor of
[obsidian-temple](https://github.com/garyng/obsidian-temple).

### Philosophy

- User experience first
- Only do templating, no scripting or shenanigans
- **KISS**, there is no need to make it complicated
- Making templating available to other plugins

### Code lineage

This project is a rewrite of [obsidian-temple](https://github.com/garyng/obsidian-temple) and some
of the code is heavily inspired from it. Unfortunately I needed to start from the ground up to suit
my big-picture target.
